I always enjoy looking back at old Minecraft screenshots. Old worlds, old builds, and old friends.
Modding my game can often get in the way of this periodic dose of nostalgia, 
with my memories being spread out over many instances and launchers, still there, but hard to reconcile.

This mod attempts to alleviate this problem to some degree by changing your 
screenshots directory to a global folder located at `%HOME%/Documents/Minecraft/Screenshots/`,
also adding a config file there for some optional extras that may help in their own way.

To help achieve its goal, the mod is intentionally as simple and "set and forget" as possible, 
requiring no configuration once installed.
Due to its simplicity, it is available on all Fabric versions since 1.17, and most likely many future versions as well.

Currently, the only optional extra is the option to automatically take screenshots when you unlock an advancement.
